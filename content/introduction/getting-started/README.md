# Getting Started

Dolt has three primary functions all with different ways to get started.

### 1. [Version Controlled Database](database.md)

Run Dolt like you would MySQL or Postgres.

### 2. [Git for Data](git-for-data.md)

Use the Dolt Command Line Interface like you would the Git Command Line Interface.

### 3. [Versioned MySQL Replica](versioned-mysql-replica.md)

Use Dolt as a replica to your primary MySQL server to get version control features without migrating.
