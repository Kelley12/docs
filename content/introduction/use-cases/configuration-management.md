# Problem

* Is your configuration too big and complex for files? 
* Are you building a game with lots of assets and configuration?
* Is your configuration more like code than configuration? 
* Does configuration have a large production impact? 
* Are configuration changes hard to review? 
* Are multiple configuration changes hard to merge together when it’s time to ship?

# Dolt solves this by…

Configuration generally manged as large text files. Diffs and merges can become problematic.
Some configuration is better modeled as tables. Tables can contain JSON columns.
Version control allows for branches, diffs, and human review of configuration changes. 
Diffs and merges happen at the cell level.
