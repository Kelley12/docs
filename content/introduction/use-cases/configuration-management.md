# Problem

* Is your configuration too big and complex for files? 
* Are you building a game with lots of assets and configuration?
* Is your configuration more like code than configuration? 
* Does configuration have a large production impact? 
* Are configuration changes hard to review? 
* Are multiple configuration changes hard to merge together when it’s time to ship?
