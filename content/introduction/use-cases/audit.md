# Problem

* Do you need to know who changed what, when, why in your SQL database?
* Do you want an immutable record of changes going back to the inception of your database?
* Is an audit team asking for this information for compliance purposes?
* Do you want to be able to query this audit log like any other tables in your database?
* Do you want the data to be efficiently stored so you can trace changes back to inception?
