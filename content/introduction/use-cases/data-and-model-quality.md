title: Data and Model Quality Control
---

# Problem

* Are you in the business of creating data and models? 
* Is it hard for you to get insights into the data used to train your models? 
* Do you want to institute human or automated review on data changes for data quality assurance?
* Are you worried about model reproducibility? 
* Do different people or teams want to work on slightly different versions of the data? 
* Are long running projects hard to pull off because of shared data? 
* Would data branches help?
* Do you want the ability to query or roll back to a previous version of the data instantly?
