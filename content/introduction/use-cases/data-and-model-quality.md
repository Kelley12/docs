title: Data and Model Quality Control
---

# Problem

* Are you in the business of creating data and models? 
* Do you want to institute human or automated review on data changes for data quality assurance?
* Are you worried about model reproducibility? 
* Do different people or teams want to work on slightly different versions of the data? 
* Are long running projects hard to pull off because of parallel data changes? 
* Would data branches help?
* Do you want the ability to query or roll back to a previous version of the data instantly?

# Dolt fixes this byâ€¦

Modern data science uses data to create models that look more like software than reports.
Version control is the standard for code. Version control for data did not exist until now.
Tags for model reproducibility.
Branches for long running data projects.
Commits, logs, and diffs for model insights.
