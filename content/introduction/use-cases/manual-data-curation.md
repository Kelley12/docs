title: Manual Data Curation
---

# Problem

* Are you using spreadsheets to curate production data? 
* Do non-technical users need the ability to edit data?
* Is the process of merging and reviewing everyone’s changes getting out of hand? 
* Are bad changes causing production issues? 
* Do you want a stepping stone to a more robust solution?

# Dolt fixes this by…

Treat that spreadsheet like code. 
Create a database on DoltHub. 
Have maintainers create branches to make changes. 
Have diff and human review
DoltHub has a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
