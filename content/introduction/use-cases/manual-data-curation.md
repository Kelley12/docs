# Problem

* Are you using spreadsheets to curate production data? 
* Is the process of merging and reviewing everyone’s changes getting out of hand? 
* Are bad data changes causing production issues? 
* Would human review of cell-level data changes help?

# Dolt solves this by…

Create a database on DoltHub. 
Have maintainers create branches to make changes.
