# Problem

* Are you expecting your application to make writes locally while offline?
* Do these writes need to be synced to a central server or other nodes?
* How are you going to detect conflicting writes?
* What are you going to do if you detect them?
* Would the Git model of clone, push, and pull on your data help?
