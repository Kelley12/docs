title: Version Control Your Application
---

# Problem

* Do your customers want branches and merges in your application? 
* Do your customers want to review changes in your application before they go live? 
* Do you want to add a pull request workflow to your application?
* Do you want to expose audit log functionality in your application?
* Do you want to expose rollback functionality in your application?

# Dolt solves this byâ€¦

If you have an application that would benefit from [branches](../../concepts/dolt/git/branch.md), [merges](../../concepts/dolt/git/merge.md), [diffs](../../concepts/dolt/git/diff.md), [logs](../../concepts/dolt/git/log.md), and human review of changes, you can use Dolt to power that application. Dolt gives you branch, diff, and merge at the database layer. 

Programmatically access git functionality via [procedures](../../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures.md), [system tables](../../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-system-tables.md), and [functions](../../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-sql-functions.md). Programmatic control of Git operations combined with the ability to use [standard SQL](../../concepts/dolt/sql/README.md) creates the ideal foundation to add version control to your application.

Dolt ships with standard [RDBMS](../../concepts/dolt/rdbms/README.md) tools like [replication](../../concepts/dolt/rdbms/replication.md) and [backups](../../concepts/dolt/rdbms/backups.md). Run Dolt with a hot standby and failover just like MySQL or Postgres.

[Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) is a hosted version of Dolt that works like AWS RDS. Let us worry about operating Dolt in the cloud. Write your application against a cloud endpoint.

In the past applications that needed these features required [slowly changing dimension](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/) or [soft deletes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-03-soft-deletes/). These approaches are cumbersome and do not support merge. Dolt gives application the full development power of Git.
