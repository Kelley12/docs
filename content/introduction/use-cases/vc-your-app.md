# Problem

* Do your customers want branches and merges in your application? 
* Do your customers want to review changes in your application before they go live? 
* Do you want to add a pull request workflow to your application?
* Do you want to expose audit log functionality in your application?
* Do you want to expose rollback functionality in your application?

# Dolt fixes this byâ€¦

Dolt gives you branch, diff, and merge at the database layer. 
Better than slowly changing dimension or soft deletes.
