title: Data Sharing
---

# Problem

* Do you share data with customers? 
* Do they ask you what changed between versions you share? 
* Do they want to actively switch versions instead of having data change out from under them? 
* Or, are customers or vendors sharing data with you? 
* Are you having trouble maintaining quality of scraped data?
* When new data is shared or scraped, do downstream systems break?
* Would you like to see exactly what changed between data versions?
* Do you want to add automated testing to data shared with you?
* Would you like to instantly rollback to the previous version if tests fail?
