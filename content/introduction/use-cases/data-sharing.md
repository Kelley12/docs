title: Data Sharing
---

# Problem

* Do you share data with customers? 
* Do they ask you what changed between versions you share? 
* Do they want to actively switch versions instead of having data change out from under them? 
* Or, are customers or vendors sharing data with you? 
* Are you having trouble maintaining quality of scraped data?
* When new data is shared or scraped, do downstream systems break?
* Would you like to see exactly what changed between data versions?
* Do you want to add automated testing to data shared with you?
* Would you like to instantly rollback to the previous version if tests fail?

# Dolt solves this by…

Dolt was built for sharing. The Git model of code sharing has scaled to thousands of contributors for open source software. We believe the same model can work for data sharing. 

[Dolt](https://www.doltdb.com) is the world's first version controlled SQL database. 

[DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) allows you to coordinate collaboration over the internet with permissions, human review, forks and all the other distributed collaboration tools you are used to from GitHub.
