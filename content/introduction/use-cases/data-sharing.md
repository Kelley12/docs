title: Data Sharing
---

# Problem

* Do you share data with customers? 
* Do they ask you what changed between versions? 
* Do they want to actively switch versions instead of having data change out from under them? 
* Or, are customers or vendors sharing data with you? 
* When new data is shared, do downstream systems break?
* Are you having trouble maintaining quality of scraped data?
