title: Versioned MySQL Replica
---

# Problem

* Is your production MySQL vulnerable to data loss? 
* If an operator runs a bad query, script, or deployment can your production MySQL can be down for hours or days as you recover data from backups or logs?
* Are you worried your backups aren't working?
* Does internal audit want and immutable log of what changes on your MySQL instance?
* Do you want the ability to copy and sync your production MySQL database for analytics, development, or debugging?

# Dolt solves this byâ€¦

Because Dolt is [MySQL-compatible](../../reference/sql/benchmarks/correctness.md), you can set Dolt up as [a versioned replica](../getting-started/versioned-mysql-replica.md) of your MySQL primary. Every transaction commit on your primary becomes a Dolt commit on the Dolt replica. 

On your Dolt replica, you get full, immutable, queryable audit log of every cell in your database. If an auditor wants guarantees that a number has not been modified, you can use Dolt to prove it. Diffs can be produced for every transaction.

If an operator makes a bad query, runs a bad script, or you make a bad deployment, you don't have to rely on backups and logs to restore which can take hours or days. Find the bad transactions using Dolt's audit capabilities. Rollback the bad individual transactions. [Produce a SQL patch](../../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-sql-functions.md#dolt_patch) and apply that back to your primary. If there are conflicting writes, Dolt will surface those for you and you can decide how to proceed. A Dolt replica becomes an essential part of your disaster recovery plan.

Moreover, Dolt can be added to your serving path as a read-only MySQL replica, so you know that it is always in sync with your primary. Your disaster recovery instance can serve production traffic so you always know it's working.

# Example

For a full example of this use case, follow the [getting started guide](../getting-started/versioned-mysql-replica.md). This section just hits the highlights.
