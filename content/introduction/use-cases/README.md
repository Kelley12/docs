# Use Cases

We built Dolt as a better way to [share data](data-sharing.md). Along the way, customers wanted an OLTP SQL database with Git features, so that is what Dolt became. Dolt is still a great way to share data but it's also [a great SQL database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/).

Anything you can build with MySQL or Postgres you can build with Dolt.

Dolt really shines when your database can benefit from [branches](../../concepts/dolt/git/branch.md), [merges](../../concepts/dolt/git/merge.md), [diffs](../../concepts/dolt/git/diff.md), or [clones](../../concepts/dolt/git/remotes.md). We've written about customers who use Dolt to [build better cancer cell simulations](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-17-dolt-turbine/), [power an application with branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-11-19-dolt-nautobot/), or [add a versioning layer to important spreadsheets](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-10-01-dolt-aktify/). These are just the customers who allowed us to write about their use case.

Other customers use Dolt to [manage video game configuration](configuration-management.md), [get an immutable audit log of changes to their database](audit.md), [build reproducibility into machine learning models](data-and-model-quality.md), [ensure data quality using a pull request workflow](manual-data-curation.md), and much more.
