Dolt is extremely simple to install. Dolt is a single ~50 megabyte program. To install it, you download or compile that program and put it on your `PATH`. For each operating system we created even simpler more familiar methods of installation.

If you want to run Dolt as a MySQL compatible server, we have additional instructions on how to do that on a Linux host or with Docker.
