# Installation

Dolt is extremely simple to install. Dolt is a single ~50 megabyte program. To install it, you download or compile that program and put it on your `PATH`. For each operating system, we created even simpler more familiar methods of installation.

* [Linux](introduction/installation/linux.md)
* [Windows](introduction/installation/windows.md)
* [Mac](introduction/installation/mac.md)
* [Build from Source](introduction/installation/source.md)

If you want to run Dolt as a MySQL compatible server, we have additional instructions on how to do that on a Linux host or with Docker.

* [Application Server](ntroduction/installation/application-server.md)
* [Docker](ntroduction/installation/docker.md)
