# What are Remotes?

Just like Git, Dolt supports syncing with a [remote database](../../../concepts/dolt/git/remotes.md). A remote is a copy of your database that is distinct from your local copy. It usually is stored on a separate host or service for fault tolerance. The primary use cases are disaster recovery and collaboration. More conceptual description of remotes can be found [here](../../../concepts/dolt/git/remotes.md).

Remotes are configured using the [`remote` command](../../cli.md#dolt-remote). Sync functionality is supported via the [`clone`](../../cli.md#dolt-clone), [`fetch`](../../cli.md#dolt-fetch), [`push`](../../cli.md#dolt-push), and [`pull`](../../cli.md#dolt-pull).
