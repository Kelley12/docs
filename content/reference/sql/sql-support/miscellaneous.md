## Collations and character sets

Dolt currently only supports a single collation and character set, the same one that Go uses: `utf8_bin` and `utf8mb4`. We will add support for more character sets and collations as required by customers. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) explaining your use case if current character set and collation support isn't sufficient.
