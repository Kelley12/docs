## Collations and character sets

Dolt supports a subset of the character sets and collations that MySQL supports.
Notably, the default character set is `utf8mb4`, while the default collation is `utf8mb4_0900_bin` (a case-sensitive collation).
This default was chosen as it has the fastest implementation, and also from a legacy perspective, as before proper collation support was added, it was the only real collation that we supported.
This differs from a standard MySQL instance, which defaults to `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (a case-insensitive collation).
Character sets and collations are added upon request, so please [file an issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) if a character set or collation that you need is missing.
