# Introduction

## Welcome to Dolt Docs

This is the documentation site for Dolt, a version-controlled SQL
database. Dolt is inspired by familiar features from MySQL and
Git. These features are combined to create powerful new kind of
relational database ideal for the evolved data landscape. Dolt is free
and open source, licensed under Apache 2.0.

Jump into [What is Dolt](introduction/what-is-dolt.md) and [Why
Dolt](introduction/why-dolt/README.md) to get a more detailed idea of
Dolt and why we built it. Or go straight to [Getting
Started](getting-started/installation.md) if you're ready for some
action!

## Documentation Overview

The documentation is divided into five parts, summarized below:

* [Getting Started](getting-started/installation.md): Installation
  instructions and the basics for getting started with Dolt

  programmatically, whether it's SQL, command line, or Python
* [Guides](guides/application-server.md): Cookbooks for installing
  dolt as an application server, using it with Python, and more
* [Integrations](../integrations/notebooks.md): A selection of other
