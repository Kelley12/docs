# Introduction

## Welcome to Dolt Docs

This is the documentation site for Dolt, a version controlled relational database. Dolt is inspired by familiar features from MySQL and Git. These features are combined to create powerful new kind of relational database ideal for the evolved data landscape. Dolt is free and open source, licensed under Apache 2.0.

Jump into [Why Dolt](introduction/why-dolt/README.md) and [What is Dolt](introduction/what-is-dolt.md) to get a more detailed idea of Dolt and why we built it, or go straight to [Getting Started](getting-started/installation.md) if you're ready for some action!

## Documentation Overview

The documentation is divided into five parts, briefly summarized below:

* [Installation](getting-started/installation.md): installation and the basics for getting started with Dolt
* [DoltHub](dolthub/getting-started.md): learn about DoltHub, a hosting and collaboration platform for Dolt databases
* [Interfaces](interfaces/sql/): find out how to interact with Dolt programmatically, whether it's SQL, command line, or Python
* [Python QuickStart](getting-started/python.md): quickstart Dolt in Python
* [Reference](reference/architecture.md): learn more about how Dolt works under the hood, as well as considerations around using Dolt in production
