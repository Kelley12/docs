# Why DoltHub?

DoltHub is a web-based interface to share, discover, and collaborate on [Dolt](./dolt.md) databases. Similar to GitHub, DoltHub let's multiple users easily collaborate on the same database at the same time. It lowers the barrier to entry for users who may want version control for their data without knowing SQL or Git or being comfortable using the command line.

## Collaboration

- Fork/pull request workflow

## Usability

- Cell buttons that generate SQL, file upload, spreadsheet editor

## Transparency

## Unbreakability
